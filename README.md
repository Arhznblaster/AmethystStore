# External Data Server for Roblox

A secure and optimized Node.js server with a Roblox ModuleScript for external data storage. This project allows you to store, retrieve, and manage player data outside of Roblox, making it easy to view and modify through a web interface while maintaining data integrity and security.

---

## Features
- **Secure Data Handling:** API key authentication to protect data access.
- **Optimized for Speed:** Asynchronous operations ensure quick data retrieval.
- **Roblox Integration:** Roblox ModuleScript for seamless communication.
- **ProfileStore Features:** Inspired by ProfileStore with metadata, data locking, and update methods.

---

## Getting Started
### Requirements
- Node.js installed on your server.
- A hosting provider (e.g., Render, Railway, DigitalOcean) or localhost for testing.
- Basic knowledge of Roblox scripting and HTTP requests.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install express dotenv
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file and add:
```
API_KEY=YourSecureApiKey
PORT=3000
```

### Step 4: Run the Server
```bash
node server.js
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## ðŸ”— Integration with Roblox
1. Place the provided **ExternalDataModule** in `ReplicatedStorage`.
2. Configure the API endpoint and API key inside the module.
3. Use the functions `getData(playerId)` and `setData(playerId, data)` to communicate with the server.

**Example Usage:**
```lua
local DataModule = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").ExternalDataModule)
local playerData = DataModule.getData("123456")
print(playerData)
```

---

## Security Considerations
- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Never expose your API key publicly.
- For production, consider rate limiting and database integration.

---

## Hosting Recommendations
- **Free Hosting:** Railway.app, Render (750 hours/month)
- **Paid Hosting:** DigitalOcean, AWS Lightsail, Linode
