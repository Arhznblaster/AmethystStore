# External Data Server for Roblox

Alright, so this is a Node.js server paired with a Roblox ModuleScript. It lets you store and mess with player data outside of Roblox itself. If you've ever wanted more control over your game's data — like checking it or tweaking it through a website — this could be what you're looking for.

## Quick notes:
- If you skip steps or don't follow the guide, and then come back here complaining that it doesn't work — that's on you.

## Why Bother With This?
- **Easy Setup:** Nothing wild here. Follow the steps, and you'll be set.
- **Secure:** Uses API keys, so not just anyone can mess with your data.
- **Optimized:** Fast, asynchronous, and not a sloppy mess.
- **Inspired by ProfileStore:** Metadata, data locking — all that good stuff.

## Getting Started
**What You Need:**
- Node.js installed.
- A hosting service (Render or Railway work fine) or just run it locally.
- Some Roblox scripting basics.

### How to Set It Up:
1. **Clone the Repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install express dotenv
   ```
3. **Set Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file:
   ```env
   API_KEY=SuperSecureKey
   PORT=3000
   ```
4. **Run the Server:**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   It'll be up on `http://localhost:3000`. Don't be careless with that API key!

## Hooking It Up to Roblox
- Drop the **ExternalDataModule** in `ReplicatedStorage`.
- Set the API endpoint and key in the module.
- Example code:

```lua
local DataModule = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").ExternalDataModule)
local playerData = DataModule.getData("123456")
print(playerData)
```

## Heads-Up Before You Mess This Up
- Don't go posting your API key for everyone to see.
- Only use HTTPS if you're deploying this for real.
- Rate-limit requests, or someone might spam and ruin your day.

---

## Hosting Options
- **Free and Simple:** Railway, Render (solid for small projects)
- **Paid and Reliable:** DigitalOcean, AWS Lightsail — if you're serious about it.
